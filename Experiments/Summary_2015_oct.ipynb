    "    2. Check if it works or not: gather both LL and EM fits on a given subset of Bayes09 for random parameters and check their correlation.\n",
    "        3. Adapt FitExperiment, as it currently expects one parameter setting and tests it on multiple datasets. It's best to run different sweeps for different datasets, they are not compatible. The handling of n_items N is not great. Should also handle evaluating metrics over a subset of the data better, check if we can do a sampling like that as well (just hack it) \n",

    "        * **Couldn't see an issue in the code. Need to launch optim and see the effect**\n",
    "        * **In summary: not really, it affects the EM fit of precision too much.**\n",
    "        * **See following notebook: [Check Loglikelihood model selection behaviour](./fitexperiment_allt_new_10_2015/notebook_LLcheck_random_fitexperimentallt_sigmaxMratiosigmaoutput_121015.ipynb)**\n",
    "    2. If sigma_output doesn't work, use lapse rate instead.\n",
    "        3. Compute new likelihood function, involves a sum of the previous one and a baseline, I think.\n",
    "            * **Done and implemented, seems to be correct**\n",
    "            * **Ran experimental fits, and obtain a better result than with sigma_output. It seems like this could work to get good fits. **\n",

    "            * ** Got acceptable fits as well, with similar characteristics. It is a harder dataset to fit though, as we've seen multiple times... **\n",
    "    2. Single experiment CMA/ES fits, compare with previous fits.\n",
    "        3. First try to run LL90-only optimisations, hope for the best.\n",
    "            * **Seems to find weird parameters values to get highest fits (lapse_rate=.2, sigma_x=0, M=600, ratio=0.4). These give very bad summary statistics, with super high kappa... **\n",
    "            * **Trying new runs now, should look at obtained model and see why it gets high LL**\n",
    "        3. Secondly, could try to do a combination of LL90 and EM fits? Not the best scales though...\n",
